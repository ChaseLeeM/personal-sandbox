        <p>I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. You're a very talented young man, with your own clever thoughts and ideas. Do you need a manager?

            So you two dig up, dig up dinosaurs? Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates Man. Man destroys God. Man creates Dinosaurs. You really think you can fly that thing?

            Yes, Yes, without the oops! Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Hey, you know how I'm, like, always trying to save the planet? Here's my chance.</p>

            My dad once told me, laugh and the world laughs with you, Cry, and I'll give you something to cry about you little bastard! We gotta burn the rain forest, dump toxic waste, pollute the air, and rip up the OZONE! 'Cause maybe if we screw up this planet enough, they won't want it anymore!

            I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus. Hey, take a look at the earthlings. Goodbye! Yeah, but John, if The Pirates of the Caribbean breaks down, the pirates donâ€™t eat the tourists. I was part of something special. I gave it a cold? I gave it a virus. A computer virus.

        What do they got in there? King Kong? Yeah, but your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn't stop to think if they should. Do you have any idea how long it takes those cups to decompose. Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here!

        Jaguar shark! So tell me - does it really exist? Must go faster. Did he just throw my cat out of the window? Must go faster. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows. Life finds a way. This thing comes fully loaded. AM/FM radio, reclining bucket seats, and... power windows.

        Forget the fat lady! You're obsessed with the fat lady! Drive us out of here! Checkmate... They're using our own satellites against us. And the clock is ticking. Must go faster... go, go, go, go, go! Is this my espresso machine? Wh-what is-h-how did you get my espresso machine?
